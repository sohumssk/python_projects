I upload some Python Projects I make during my spare time

Hello coders, when I'm learning a new language I like to explore it by making simple projects in it. Right now I'm learning Python and making basic Python projects.
You're free to use my codes wherever you'd like to. I'd love recommendations to upgrade these projects. Thanks for contributing!
